            I can't believe that I have been to this place twice and never made
            a review about it. Well I love this place alot! Still i havent truly
            discover the whole place yet coz I only went during the RWMF and
            quite occupied with the activities. My recommendation is if you
            wanna really explore the place, avoid the period of the festival,
            unless you come for the festival of course, which is awesome. The
            problem during festival is, they closed some of the exhibition due
            to some reason and there will be no cultural dance and normal
            performance as per normal days for you to experience. As for the
            RWMF, there will be 9 workshops to choose from during day time and
            concerts starts at 7pm till 12am, for 3 days in a row (Fri-Sun).
            Sunday night performance is not to be missed as it's the finale
            night and all performers will be performing bits and pieces of their
            previous performance in case you missed it. You can opt to stay near
            the Cultural Village, in the village itself or also in Kuching town
            as there'll be plenty of shuttle buses to go to and from Kuching
            town. Previously i'd prefer to stay in Kuching town so I could have
            breakfast options in town as workshop only starts in the afternoon.
            But now there's a food court just opposite of the Cultural Village,
            called Damai Sentral, which sells reasonable priced food (compared
            to inside the village) and variety of local dish to choose from too.

            There is a wonderful dance show, check times first. Tours of
            longhouses, and other housing is very interesting! Don't need to
            take tour, take a taxi instead, 110 MYR roundtrip, including wait +
            ticket. People at center very informative!

            The cultural show was good as you can see the native actor flirt
            with girls and it was funny. But the whole walk around the park to
            view the different type of long houses was tiring.

            A fun day out. We got to fire blow darts and try the dancing. Worth
            a look if you're passing through.

            This is a good place for tourist to explore the culture of different
            ethnic of Sarawak. But it could be a bit pricey for the entrance
            fee, there is only cheaper rate for Sarawakians and students. Do not
            miss their scheduled shows.

            When the RMF isn't here, would be the best time to visit, quiet. All
            model houses are genuinely designed according to the original
            dwelling structure of each ethnic group. Spectacular display of
            variability in indigenous cultures, and their rich heritage. Another
            successful 'living museum' for Sarawak.

            Ok the first the we reached there we were shocked with the price..
            Adults is rm60 n kids is rm30. Bring or show wtv student card you
            have so you get kids price!!!! We spent half a day there to cover
            the whole place and watch the cultural show and also had lunch which
            was surprisingly not expensive compared to the entrance fee!!! The
            houses in the cultural village were unique, interesting, every house
            tells a different story and how it was years ago.. & also activities
            in the houses that you can also try. The cultural show was situated
            in the theatre !!! A well high class theatre!!!!!!!! The show showed
            different ethics n it's a must watch. You learn a lot I must say. Do
            come!! :)

            My husband and I went to the Rainforest Music Festival in July 2011.
            Having been to other festivals over the years, I must say this one
            was refreshing for a few reasons: 1. no drugs or rif-raff, 2.
            historical interest due to the location, 3. unbelievable variety of
            music. The show was really well run--no lag time in between acts,
            everything ran on time. The food was amazing--local food of all
            different types. The only corporate sponsor was Heineken and
            CoffeeBean. In one night, we heard Eastern European music, Irish
            traditional music, Dominican Republic traditional music, and Zydeco
            from Louisiana. My husband and I are both American Expats living in
            Singapore. It was an easy flight to Kuching, and the shuttle was
            reliable, except for at the end of the night the traffic got really
            backed up, so it took a while to get back to the hotel. But
            whatever, can't win them all. PS, bathrooms were pretty clean and
            had toilet paper.

            I had a lovely time at the Cultural village. Although it certainly
            is a family attraction, it is worth a visit for the adults too. It
            gives a good idea of tribal life in the forest, and the cultural
            dances show is of good quality. I was surprised that I liked the
            whole thing, and the jungle atmosphere, combined with the proximity
            of the beaches, makes it a good attraction close to the city.
