In this Project, your job is to create a list of Tasks for a “My Weekly Planner” website. Information about the tasks should be stored in a JSON file. 

The container should have 3 columns in a row for large screens (provided layout), 2 columns in a row for medium screens and 1 column in a row for small/extra small screens. 

 Correct creation of JSON file to hold the information of the Tasks. 

 Correct creation of the HTML/Bootstrap structure dynamically using JavaScript. This should not be hard coded: elements should be created by JavaScript rather than written in the HTML file. The following should be shown on the screen: the Task’s name, a short description, a representative image and the Priority level field with the representative number.  

 Every time the “Importance” button is clicked, the number of “importance” (the number shown next to the “Importance” button in the template) should increase by one (1). 

 As it is in the example template, the background color of the priority level number will change depending on the displayed number.   

The colors should be as follow (bootstrap colors): 

Between 0 – 1 -> Green = (success) 

Between 2 – 3 -> Yellow = (warning) 

Between 4 – 5 -> Red = (danger) 

Make sure that every “Task” has an initial value 0 = Green.

 Add a Sort button that will sort the resulting list of tasks according to their current level of importance (e.g. on ascending order, it will organize the Tasks from less important to more important).
