        <h3>CAN I SUBSTITUTE THIS INGREDIENT?</h3>
        <p>
          I recommend using the specified ingredients listed in the recipe
          whenever possible for optimal results. I understand that you may have
          dietary restrictions or simply do not have a particular ingredient on
          hand, but please remember that by using a substitution, I cannot speak
          for how much this will change in the overall taste or texture of the
          dish without further recipe testing.
        </p>
        <p>Using a substitution may also result in a mediocre outcome.</p>
        <h3>
          I TRIED ONE OF YOUR RECIPES BUT IT DID NOT TURN OUT. WHAT DID I DO
          WRONG?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Please understand that it is very hard for me to specifically answer
          this question since I am not in the kitchen with you. That being said,
          I only share recipes that have been successful and well-tested in my
          own kitchen, but I understand that failures and mishaps can happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of blaming the recipe, it is important to remember that many
          factors are at play here that may result in a failed outcome. But with
          a little bit more information, we can troubleshoot what went wrong to
          have a successful turnaround next time.
        </p>
        <h3>
          WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO STORE LEFTOVERS? HOW LONG WILL THIS KEEP?
        </h3>
        <p>
          As I am not an expert on food safety, I am not comfortable answering
          these questions. Methods for optimal food storage and shelf life
          should be based on good judgment and what you are personally
          comfortable with.
        </p>
        <h3>CAN I FREEZE THIS?</h3>
        <p>
          I will provide instructions and tips on dishes that I have frozen
          myself but unfortunately, I do not freeze all of my recipes so I
          cannot always answer this question. Please use your best judgment for
          freezing and reheating.
        </p>
        <h3>CAN I USE A SLOW COOKER OR INSTANT POT FOR THIS RECIPE INSTEAD?</h3>
        <p>
          Please understand that it is very difficult to give exact conversion
          information without further recipe testing. As always, please use your
          best judgement to convert my recipes to utilize a slow cooker or IP.
        </p>
        <h3>CAN YOU SHARE THE NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION FOR THIS RECIPE?</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, as I am not a registered dietician, I am not
          comfortable sharing nutritional information for any of my recipes. I
          recommend utilizing online calorie counters at your discretion to
          obtain such information.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I have recently teamed up with an amazing nutritionist, Pam
          Gibson. She will be providing important nutritional information for
          select and new recipes at this time.
        </p>
        <h3>
          HOW DO I SIGN UP FOR EMAIL UPDATES TO STAY-UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR NEW
          RECIPES? IS THE SUBSCRIPTION FREE?
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can sign up for free email updates
          <a class="faq-link" href="#">here</a> to have new recipes delivered
          right to your inbox. Yes, it’s really free!
        </p>
        <h3>
          I SIGNED UP FOR THE EMAIL UPDATES BUT I CAN’T FIND A PARTICULAR
          RECIPE. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The email updates are for new and select recipes at this time. If you
          need to find a particular recipe, you can browse through the
          <a class="faq-link" href="#"> recipe index</a> or utilize the search
          bar located on the top right sidebar. And if all else fails,
          <a class="faq-link" href="#">Google</a> is also very helpful!
        </p>
        <h3>CAN I WRITE A GUEST POST FOR YOUR SITE?</h3>
        <p>
          I really appreciate the offer but I am not accepting guest posts on my
          site at this time.
        </p>
        <h3>DO YOU BLOG FULL-TIME?</h3>
        <p>
          I am happy to say that as of September 2013 I transitioned into
          becoming a full-time blogger, although having a day job and
          maintaining a blog was more like having two full-time jobs! This
          decision did not come lightly as I obtained a Master’s degree in
          Public Health in May 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          With over $180,000 debt in student loans, I promised myself that I
          would use my degree but my love for cooking and running this blog
          eventually won out, and I am so incredibly grateful to have this job.
          I admit that you really have to work your butt off to maintain a blog
          and to be an entrepreneurial business owner, in a sense, but at the
          end of the day, I truly <b>love</b> my job. Plus, there’s always food
          on the dinner table!
