          I have a recipe that calls for plain flour and baking soda. My
          question is : can I omit the baking soda if I have self rising flour?

          I was wondering if you were planning to make an app in future? I was
          just thinking about what to make for dinner and was thinking how much
          I would love a Damn Delicious app.

          Greetings! I drink Rice Dream Rice Drink everyday. I enjoy the taste
          immensely in my herbal teas. I have a “soy” milk maker and have tried
          making my own rice milk, but it never comes out tasting anything like
          this store-bought product. I would really like to make my own rice
          milk to save on cost (it’s expensive) and to eliminate the canola oil.
          Have you any great recipes for rice milk? Thank you, Poppy
        </p>

          Sounds like a great dog food. Can you tell me how much to feed a 14#
          adult dog?

          Any chance you are working on some ‘gluten-free’ recipes to offer as
          alternatives for condiments, dressings, and soups?

          We use your recipes all the time at our house and we love them! My
          kids are very curious about why you named your site damn delicious and
          were wondering if you could tell us about it? Thanks.

          Not sure about the stuff you call fish sauce in some of your recipes.
          I’m not a huge fan of an overly fishy taste. Thinking about making the
          Thai Chicken. Explanations and or recommendations about some
          ingredients would be helpful.
